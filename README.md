  1. Congrats on navigating to this repository as that is our first step!<br>
  2. As you can see this repository has a few files and an executable that is necessary to submit answers for this question,<br>
  The way you can easily move these to your own local directory is with the following command <br>
  ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/BenBastianelli/Foobar_problem_2.git 
  ```
<br>
Once this repository is cloned you should have access to all of the files and the problem is now ready to be attempted!!

## âœ… Submitting a solution âœ… <br>

</div>

**submitting a solution** is a relatively straight forward process and has everything to do with the executable you pulled when you cloned this repository ` Grade_code.exe ` <br>
to submit a solution you **must** run this executable and provide it with the following information : <br>
` Your Team Name ` <br> <br>
` The name of your solution file ` <br> **(MAKE SURE IT IS IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE EXECUTABLE TO ENSURE THE EXECUTABLE CAN FIND IT)** <br> <br>
` The name of the method you use to load your CSV data into the script ` <br> **(ONLY INCLUDE THE NAME NO '()' OR 'def')** <br> <br>
` The name of the method you use to create your graph ` <br> **(ONLY INCLUDE THE NAME NO '()' OR 'def')** <br>
<br>
after this click the "grade code" button at the bottom of the executable and (after almost crashing) the executable will return your grade and update it on the live leaderboard
