  1. Congrats on navigating to this repository as that is our first step!<br>
  2. As you can see this repository has a few files and an executable that is necessary to submit answers for this question,<br>
  The way you can easily move these to your own local directory is with the following command <br>
  ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/BenBastianelli/Foobar_problem_2.git 
  ```
<br>
Once this repository is cloned you should have access to all of the files and the problem is now ready to be attempted!!

## âœ… Submitting a solution âœ… <br>

</div>

**submitting a solution** is a relatively straight forward process and has everything to do with the executable you pulled when you cloned this repository ` Grade_code.exe ` <br>
to submit a solution you **must** run this executable and complete the following<br>
1. Ensure your file name for submission follows the following format : ` TeamName_Solution.py ` <br> <br>
2. Click your team name when it pops up on the executable screen <br>**(NOTE THE EXECUTABLE AND SOLUTION FILE MUST BE LOCATED IN THE SAME DIRECTORY)** <br> <br>
3. Click the *"Grade Selected"* button option <br> <br>
4. Your script will be automatically graded and your score on the leader board will be updated <br> <br>

<br>
after this click the "grade code" button at the bottom of the executable and (after almost crashing) the executable will return your grade and update it on the live leaderboard
